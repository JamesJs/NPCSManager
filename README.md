### Nitro+ Console Script Manager (NPCSM) - v0.9 - Need Char Remap
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ForumHulp/pageaddon.svg?branch=master)](http://vnx.uvnworks.com)

A DLL Library tool to allow you write your own string editor in C#

The Encoding.cs contains a big map for S;G 0 Letters, but i see wrongs mapping, have too much letters and i don't have plan to translate this game, if you need you can remap manually in the Encoding.cs, just give a value between 0x8000~0x9D00 and test in game...

Created to edit scripts from Steins;Gate 0: PC

If You like, give-me a star plz~~
